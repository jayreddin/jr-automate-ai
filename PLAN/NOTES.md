## Initial Thoughts and Ideas

*   Consider using a drag-and-drop interface for node arrangement.
*   Explore different options for implementing variables (e.g., global variables, local variables).
*   Investigate the possibility of integrating with third-party services.
*   Think about how to handle errors and exceptions in the automation flows.
*   Research existing version control systems for inspiration.
*   The HTTP Request Node should support various methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
*   The Date/Time Node should allow users to specify different formats.
*   The Conditional Logic Node should support multiple conditions.
