    -   Include a retract button for the sidebar.
2.  **Header and Footer Reorganization:**
    -   Move the "Save Flow" button to the top of the sidebar.
    -   Move the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons to the footer below the sidebar.
    -   Move the search bar to the right side of the header.
    -   Move the sign-in button to the left side of the header.
    -   Center the "Run Flow" button in the header.

5.  **Footer Settings Button:**
    -   Remove the "Ready" text from the footer.
    -   Replace it with a settings button that opens a popup with various app settings.
6.  **UI/UX Overhaul:**
    -   Implement a complete UI/UX change, including new colors and styles.
    -   Explore the use of MUI (Material UI) or other UI libraries.
