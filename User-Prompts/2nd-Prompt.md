Redo that step and call the /agent-context-discovery to review all the code files and for them to make a new folder (Mode-Info) in the codebase and a new file (1stReview.md) in the new folder and document a rough review of the codebase.

when they are finished check and confirm the new folder and file is present.

Next call the /agent-research to make a new folder called APIDOCS and then to use the context7 MCP server and retrieve the puter.com api docs and save them in the new folder.

when they are finished check and confirm the new folder and file is present.

Next call the /agent-context-condenser to review the new files and condense them into more manageable files in a new folder it will create (Context) and a new file called context-condense.md and fill this out with the information.

when they are finished check and confirm the new folder and file is present.

Next call the /manager-onboarding mode to receive my initial plans and help organise it, they will create a new folder (PLAN) and create the PRD.md and NOTES.md files and populate them as necessary.
