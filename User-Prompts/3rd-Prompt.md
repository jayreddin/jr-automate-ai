OK I want to first have the code file thoroughly reviewed by the /util-reviewer mode and then the findings are to be documented in the Mode-Info folder in a new created file called 2ndReview.md

Next I want the files debugged by /dev-fixer and if /debug mode is needed too, again these changes nd findings are documented in the Mode-Info folder in a new file created called bug-fixes.md.

Next I want the app optimized, by /util-performance mode and my codebase improved, also the mode documents it in a newly created file in the Mode-Info folder called optimize.md 


Next I want /prime-txt to add comments to every file explaining what the functions etc do. just comments to make the code files easier to read.

Then Lastly I want you to update the NOTES.md file with the current fixes, when that's done you can come back to me and ask me about new features and ideas for the app.
