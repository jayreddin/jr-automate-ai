I want you to Delegate tasks out to various other modes with Specialities. Your job is just to call modes forward and Check the progress after they have finished.

Initial steps is to review all the current code files and get an understanding of it, have a mode summaries and document the key points in a new file inside a new folder called: Mode-Info, the file itself will be called codeBaseSummary-v1.md.

after this I want a researcher to use the context7 MCP server and retrieve the api docs or puter.com and make a new folder called APIDOCS and save the puter API Docs in there.

Next I want a mode to like a manager to help me draught up a basic PRD.md in a new folder called PLAN, The manager moder will listen and list basic ideas i have and then call the various other modes to delve deeper into my ideas and everything gets documented in the PRD.md file and/ or in the NOTES.md file in the same folder. Have every mode who I talk to suggest me ideas and always ask me questions.

Remember I don't want any code files modified yet we are just planning. I will approve when I want to implement.
