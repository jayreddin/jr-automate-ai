OK I want to completely change the styles, colours and layout of the UI. We'll start with this as its major changes. Add a new file in the @/PLAN folder called UI-Change-plan.md in this file is where the UI change plan will be detailed down in phases and steps.

I'll give you changes a couple at a time and we add them to the plan and then I'll give you more.

These are the modes I want /design-ui, /agent-research, /lead-design /util-reviewer, /lead-frontend, /util-performance. Possibly others will be needed also. Each when needed will add to the UI-Change-plan.md file and add they're name next to what they added.

So here is a brief idea of the first few changes:

1. I want to move the side bar from the left to the right side, I want to implement categories when one is selected then the nodes to that category show. also want the 1st sidebar display options to be triggers only, when a trigger is selected then the Actions etc will show. Also want the sidebar to have a retract button so user can slide it away.

2.  I want to reorganise the elements and shuffle them around and move some. I want the "Save Flow" button to be moved to the top of the side bar in the side bar, I then want to move the undo and redo buttons to the footer below the side bar.  I want to move the search bar to the right hand side of the header and the sign in button over to the left hand side of the header and the Run Flow button centered.

3. I want to change the Zoom bar to just 2 magnafying glasses + and - Remove the reset button for now.

4. Move the Output panel to the left side, swapped with the sidebar.

5. in the footer the layout should be remove the ready text and replace with a settings button that pops a pop up with various app settings.

6. I want a complete UI/UX change, colours, maybe use MUI instead, the modes can suggest some to me.

OK  now thats a brief description of the first major changes, send out various modes so discuss the changes more with me and ask me questions, give me suggestions etc. I want this change done very detailed and slowly with caution as to not break the code.
