# Debugging Findings - Bug Fixes

## Summary
The debugging process identified several issues in the code that need attention to improve robustness and error handling.

## Detailed Findings
- **Error Handling:** Asynchronous operations across modules lack proper try-catch blocks.
- **Edge Case Coverage:** Certain functions do not adequately handle edge cases, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Logging:** Insufficient logging in error conditions makes troubleshooting more difficult.

## Recommendations
- Add comprehensive try-catch blocks in asynchronous sections.
- Improve input validation and error-checking to handle edge cases.
- Integrate detailed logging to capture error states and facilitate future debugging.

## File-specific Notes
- **nodes/ai.js:** Review API call error handling.
- **nodes/file.js:** Add validations for file read/write operations.
- **nodes/delay.js:** Ensure timeout errors are properly captured and logged.

## Next Steps
- Apply the recommended fixes.
- Rerun tests to verify that the issues have been resolved.

## Conclusion
Implementing these improvements will enhance the reliability and maintainability of the codebase.
